Handcrafting Award Winning Chocolate
from Bean to Finished Bar! 

Said to be a gift from the gods, "brought to the people on a beam of the morning star", Cacao truly is one of natures finest fruits.
At Starchild Chocolate we combine this wonderful gift with only the very best, healthy, organic ingredients, to create for you a unique chocolate experience.
We are a small batch chocolate maker offering some of the most delectable, organic, low glycemic chocolate treats available.
We strive to work with cacao in a way that not only lives up to our high standards as chocolatiers, but as well, lives up to our strong morals in regards to ethical, just and fair business practice.
We start by sourcing out some of the worlds finest organic cacao from regions all across the globe.
Then with gentle care and a desire to bring out each beans full potential we handcraft it in small batches using traditional methods of stone grinding.
Next we combine the low glycemic sweetness of coconut blossom sugar.
And finally if were not making one of our favorite two ingredient chocolates, we add an array of beneficial healthy, nuts, fruits, herbs and spices to finish with a beautiful product that is not only good for your senses but your health as well.
